This site is my one-stop home for writing, data visualization work, biblical studies notes, and interactive demos.

## Author

I write to think clearly, document what I am learning, and publish work that is useful to other people.

## Data Visualization / BI

I build practical dashboards and data stories using SQL, Python, R, Tableau, and Power BI.

## Biblical Studies

I publish study notes and reflections focused on careful reading, context, and application.
